# EpigenTL
EpigenTL (Epigenetic Transfer Learning) provides tools to integrating diverse biological datasets with transfer learning (TL), with a focus on but not limited to, epigenetic DNA methylation (DNAm) data. This package also provides algorithms to estimate blood DNAm biomarkers from saliva DNAm profiles, foregoing the need for invasive blood draws.
